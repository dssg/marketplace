The fields org_pk and user_pk represent the IDs of the organization that will
own the project and the user that will be assigned as first administrator of
the project. These IDs must exist before loading the projects, and the user
assigned as project owner must belong to the organization  that the project is
created under.

The banner image must be specified through a URL, so it has to be hosted elsewhere.
