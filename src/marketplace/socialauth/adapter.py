    django-allauth handles authentication of users against OAuth
    providers. And when this proves to be an existing User, it's then
    largely just a matter of logging them in.

    In the case of the authentication of a new User, however, allauth
    populates a new User instance -- and otherwise without the
    involvement of this codebase. So the allauth-constructed User
    is processed here, before it is later persisted in the database.
