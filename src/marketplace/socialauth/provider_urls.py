# Note: This is not the documented manner of installing allauth paths.
# Rather, for example, you might:
#
#     path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
#
# (And you certainly don't need a separate urls module for that purpose.)
#
# However, that installs all of allauth's account-handling controllers.
# For now, we only need OAuth provider URLs.
#
# So instead, we use this module to cleanly define just the provider paths,
# and then include these as needed.
